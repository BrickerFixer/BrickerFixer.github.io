<h2>About</h2>
<p>Hello, I am Bricker (Further referred in the other posts as just B, just for the sake of keeping it short). I am a teen that tries to develop some applications that are better off be closed from society altogether, because they end up flopping miserably.</p>

<p>What I know:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Java (specifically Android dev)</li>
  <li>Some Kotlin (specifically Android dev)</li>
  <li>Python (basics, but I have some experience in FastAPI)</li>
  <li>Linux</li>
</ul>

<p>I made this blog just to share my thoughts and not leave my github pages space empty. Here I'll tell about projects of mine and possibly share some new stuff. Consider it a... Dumpster of sorts.</p>
